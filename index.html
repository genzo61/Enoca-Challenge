<h2><a href="blog-single.html">Pro-Palestinian group targets BBC London headquarters with red paint ‘blood’ protest</a></h2>
<p class="mb-3">The BBC’s Broadcasting House headquarters in London has been targeted and daubed in red paint by a pro-Palestinian group.

  BBC presenter Victoria Derbyshire shared images and a video of the exterior of the building on Saturday morning.
  
  Alongside the video showing the outside of the BBC covered in red paint, she wrote: "Just arrived at work. This is the front entrance to BBC this morning."
  
  A Pro-Palestinian group has claimed responsibility for vandalising the BBC’s Broadcasting House headquarters with red paint over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
  
  Palestine Action accused the broadcaster of having “blood on it hands” after staging the protest in London in the early hours of Saturday morning.
  
  It also targeted the BBC’s Hanover Building in Liverpool city centre, again spraying it with red paint to symbolise its “complicity in spilling Palestinian blood”.

<h2><a href="blog-single.html">Friends star Matthew Perry dies at 54</a></h2>
<p class="mb-3">US actor Matthew Perry, best known for playing wisecracking Chandler Bing in the hit '90s TV sitcom Friends, has died at the age of 54.

  The actor was found dead at his home in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources told US media.
  
  Friends, which followed the fortunes of six young friends living in New York City, aired from 1994 until 2004.
  
  Its final episode was watched by 52.5 million in the US, making it the most watched TV episode of the 2000s.

  Matthew Perry's life in pictures
  The LA Times and TMZ, which first reported that Perry had died, said the actor was found unresponsive in a hot tub at his house.
  
  A Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson told the BBC that first responders went to an address in the Pacific Palisades area, regarding a "water emergency" of an unknown type, but did not name Perry.
  
  Warner Bros, which produced the long-running show whose global reruns were loved by new generations of viewers, described Perry as a "true gift to us all".
  
  Born in Massachusetts in 1969, Perry was raised in Ottawa, Canada, where he attended elementary school with Justin Trudeau, who later became Canadian prime minister.
  
  Canada's leader wrote on X: "Matthew Perry's passing is shocking and saddening. I'll never forget the schoolyard games we used to play, and I know people around the world are never going to forget the joy he brought them. Thanks for all the laughs, Matthew. You were loved - and you will be missed."
  
  Perry moved to Los Angeles as a teenager. He starred as Chazz Russell in Boys Will Be Boys and also had roles in shows including Growing Pains.
  
  But he became an international star on Friends, a show which followed the lives of six New Yorkers navigating dating, careers and friendship.</p>

<p class="mb-3">Within hours of the attack on a shopping centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, false and unproven claims began circulating online.
  Stories were spread by Russian Telegram channels and by Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Nations. They included rumours that the attack was "false" or "staged" - and were repeated on Russian television.
  On Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry released a statement claiming the shopping centre was "non-functioning" and that the bombing of a nearby ammunitions dump sparked a secondary fire at the centre. Those claims were denied by Ukrainian officials.</p>

<p class="mb-3">The allegation comes from diary entries by former chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance.

  Meanwhile, ex-adviser Dominic Cummings told the inquiry the government had no plan and was in "complete chaos".
  
  The inquiry was also shown offensive messages sent by Mr Cummings about cabinet ministers and top officials.
  
  Lee Cain, No 10's former communications director, said the pandemic was the "wrong crisis" for Mr Johnson and he was a "challenging character to work with" because he kept changing his mind.
  
  The government's handling of the Covid crisis was laid bare in a day of candid testimony by the prime minister's former advisers.
  
  At one point, the inquiry was shown notes by Sir Patrick, who wrote of his frustrations in dealing with Mr Johnson in his diaries.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67264350l">Scientists excited by AI tool that grades severity of rare cancer</a></h2>
